This folder contains the codes for evaluating the effectiveness of time synchronization:

The clock error is varied through the following configuration.

**.clock.err_std = ${Offset=0,25,50,75,100,200,300,400,500}ms

The simulation results can be found in the /simulation/results folder: 

\TimeSynchronizationTestCases\simulations\FastSMR-TimeSync.anf: contains the experiment result for observing the interaction latency with different clock offsets.

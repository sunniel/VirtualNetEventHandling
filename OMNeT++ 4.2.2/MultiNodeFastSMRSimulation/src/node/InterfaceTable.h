/**
 * Represents the interface table. This object has one instance per host
 * or router. It has methods to manage the interface table,
 * so one can access functionality similar to the "ifconfig" command.
 *
 * See the NED documentation for general overview.
 *
 * This is a simple module without gates, it requires function calls to it
 * (message handling does nothing). Methods are provided for reading and
 * updating the interface table.
 *
 * Interfaces are dynamically registered: at the start of the simulation,
 * every L2 module adds its own InterfaceEntry to the table; after that,
 * IPv4's IRoutingTable and IPv6's RoutingTable6 (an possibly, further
 * L3 protocols) add protocol-specific data on each InterfaceEntry
 * (see IPv4InterfaceData, IPv6InterfaceData, and InterfaceEntry::setIPv4Data(),
 * InterfaceEntry::setIPv6Data())
 *
 * Interfaces are represented by InterfaceEntry objects.
 *
 * When interfaces need to be reliably and efficiently identified from other
 * modules, interfaceIds should be used. They are better suited than pointers
 * because when an interface gets removed (see deleteInterface()), it is
 * often impossible/impractical to invalidate all pointers to it, and also
 * because pointers are not necessarily unique (a new InterfaceEntry may get
 * allocated exactly at the address of a previously deleted one).
 * Interface Ids are unique (Ids of removed interfaces are not issued again),
 * stale Ids can be detected, and they are also invariant to insertion/deletion.
 *
 * Clients can get notified about interface changes by subscribing to
 * the following notifications in NotificationBoard: NF_INTERFACE_CREATED,
 * NF_INTERFACE_DELETED, NF_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGED, NF_INTERFACE_CONFIG_CHANGED.
 * State change gets fired for up/down events; all other changes fire as
 * config change.
 *
